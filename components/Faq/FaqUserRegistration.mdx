<Button
  className="p-button-text p-button-rounded p-button-outlined"
  label="WhatsApp"
  aria-label="WhatsApp"
  icon="pi pi-whatsapp"
  onClick={() => window.open(`https://wa.me/${adminWhatsApp}`)}
/>

#### My account is linked using Facebook and wanted to switch to Google login, how can I do it?

You can't. You can only link 1 social account with your email. As an alternative you can login using your email instead.

export default ({ children }) => <div>{children}</div>;
