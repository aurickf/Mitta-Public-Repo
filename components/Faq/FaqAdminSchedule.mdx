#### I already scheduled a class but it's not visible for members to book. What should I check?

1. Check if the class is published, if the class is not published then it not be visible to members.

2. Check if the class is marked as VIP Only, if the class is VIP only, non-VIP members cannot view the class.

export default ({ children }) => <div>{children}</div>;
