## Best Practice

#### Class Creation, Update, and Deletion

- Due to API rate _[limitation][1]_ from Zoom, create your recurring classes to be ended on monthly basis or at maximum a quarter year basis.

- Although not restricted, it is better not to reschedule to a different date.

- You can create and edit a template without an instructor assigned to it, however it is mandatory for a class to have an instructor.
  Therefore, it is advised to always have at least one instructor assigned to a template for more seamless experience.

- Regarding class deletion, unless created by mistake, it's not advised to delete a class eventhough it's status is _Cancelled_.
  In the report ( _Tools > Analysis > [Statistic Report][3]_ ), you can get accurate numbers only if you kept cancelled class as it was, instead of removing it from database.

#### Cloud Storage

User avatar and membership's proof of payment is stored on Amazon Cloud Service (AWS).
User avatar will be kept forever, however proof of payment images will be deleted automatically on agreed time frame.
These period is adjustable however we cannot keep it in AWS forever as it will accumulate over time and became a Paid Tier.

If you need to keep proof of payment data on undetermined time frame, you can download and store it elsewhere.
