## Known Limitation

#### Phone Number

User phone number is not verified.

#### Class Creation and Editing

There are no limitation on class creation and editing on our database. However, there are limitation from Zoom. <br/>
Meeting creation is limited to 100 meetings / day, meeting update also limited to 100 update / day.

If you accidentaly hit the rate limit, please wait for 24 hours for Zoom counter to reset.

On a side note, classes linked with Zoom meetings also always take more time to process creation and update requests. <br/>
This behaviour is expected due to additional steps required on server side.

#### Recurring Holidays

As per today, holiday is not set to be a recurring event. You will need to re-adjust the dates for upcoming year.
