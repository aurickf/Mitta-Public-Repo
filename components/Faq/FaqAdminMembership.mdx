#### A membership request is approved by mistake, what should be done?

These steps need to be taken in correct order

2. Verify the correct request

   Change the status of the correct request to be verified

3. Deverify the incorrect request

#### What happened when I deverified a membership?

The purpose of deverifying is to cancel a mistaken membership request approval.

When a membership is verified, member's available balance is added accordingly depends on the package of their purchase.
Therefore, upon deverified, member's current balance will be deducted respectively.

#### What are the restriction on deverifying a membership?

On verifying a membership, it is automatically updated into the latest membership of its user.
All membership information such as available balance, validity date, booking information, etc., is stored in latest membership record.
Therefore the application restricting latest membership to be deverified.

To make this invalid membership **not to be the latest**, simply verify a new valid request, this new request upon approval will then be the latest membership.
